This is a semester-long, Oregon Trail-style game in Java which manipulates user input to play.
There are various game objects using abstraction concepts including inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.
All of the code is located in the src folder.  There are many different classes and objects which contribute to the game.

In order to play the game, run the "Main" class in the "a8" folder.
